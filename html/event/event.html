            <p>PDCA T20 5th Match Dt : 10/05/14</p>
            <p>Venue : Neharu Stadium (Turf Wicket !) Time : 01.00pm</p>
            <p>The match was played on Saturday due to ground availability issues.</p>
            <p>SCC were not in full strength. However, SCC were excited because venue of many international matches in past and was being played on turf.</p>
            <p>For COM it was their home ground as they played all matches and go thru daily drills and net at same venue.</p>
            <p>On hot afternoon COM won and elected to bat. SCC did reasonable well to not allow COM opening pair Kunal & Aniket to run away. In first 10 overs COM were 67 /0. All SCC bowlers Nikit, Ravi, Yuvi, Satish, Akshay, Chetal kept them under check but could not find wickets till 19th over when Nikit got Kunal on the boundary, with score reading 130.</p>
            <p>The last over started with 136 runs with nine batsmen remaining for COM and they had target of 160 in mind. But Ravi had other idea. The 1st ball found Pankaj plumb in front, 2nd ball took off stump of Sujit & Atul was cleaned up by Ravi for his first Hat trick</p>
            <p>…As Aniket wanted desperately to take strike he ran off the forth ball defended by Bandal….But Ravi ran Bandal out with direct throw…</p>
            <p>The fifth ball was a wide & got COM 5 extra.. The legal fifth ball had Aniket right in front of the wicket for LBW… Pandit who was facing final ball was out of sea to get a perfect Yorker & he too was LBW………. giving 5 wickets (4-0-19-5) to Ravi and six in an over for SCC which is a record to remember. COM made 141 / 7 in 20 overs.</p>
            <p>SCC started confidently before Amol left Nikit after making good 11 & score reading 30/1 in 5th over. Sudhakar Joined & made good use of his hitting poweress & made 18 before getting out. Satish too followed soon leaving too much for Nikit. Ravi made run a ball 18 but was not enough.</p>
            <p>Nikit stood alone to make a match of it but in order to push the rate he fell after making well-polished 45 and SCC lost 24 runs..</p>
            <p>There was a mix feeling …Happy playing at turf & renowned venue …..joy of the good team performance but for the loss in last match losing the Group winner tag..</p>
            <p>But surely Club of Maharashtra will also remember this day for last over strikes by Ravi !</p>
