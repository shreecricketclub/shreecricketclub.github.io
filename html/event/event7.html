            <p>After a year long gap, SCC's was back in the PDCA T20 Tournament.
            <p>Evergreen XI won the toss and put SCC to bat. SCC had a steady start with Amol and Sumedh Awati opening the batting. Amol scored a swift 25 and got out to a very good yorker by Ramesh. The run rate was good but wickets kept on falling. Sudhakar hit a brisk 32, though he was not batting upto his potential he still managed to get a brisk 26 ball 32 runs before getting runout. Later, the SCC batting looked pretty ordinary. Ravi was looking in a good touch till he was bowled out by Chetan Pardeshi on 22. With some scratchy batting display SCC managed to put on a total of 145 runs.
            <p>Now it was all upto the bowling department, as it always stood to the test of the time. After a year long gap SCC bowlers looked rusty. Evergreen batting got a flying start. They were charging to their score but Yuvraj could manage to take the first wicket. In no time the second wicket fell on 39 run and SCC were back into the game. But, the batsmen batted sensibly and kept on getting crucial singles and hitting an odd boundary. Later, spinners were brought into the attack and they tried to keep it tight. Sandeep conceded 12 runs in his first over but still Dhananjay kept faith in him and gave him another over where he took 2 wickets in quick succession and SCC was right back into the game.
            <p>But the Evergreen batsmen look unstoppable after that and they cruised to the total. Dhananjay kept it tight but others could not support him all the way. Later, Yuvraj was brought back into the attack and thanks to Sudhakar's lightning reflexes SCC could get a wicket in crucial times and was back into the game. SCC tried their best to keep it tight into the death overs and get Evergreen all-out. But, they could not avoid the evident and went down in their very first encounter.
            <p>SCC will have a lot to think about their bowling and fielding performance. Just with the first loss in the tournament SCC cannot be written off so soon.
            <p>Best performers :
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>Sudhakar (32 runs & 2 Stumping)</li>
                <li>Ravikumar Patil (A Quick 22 runs in 10 balls + 1wkt + 1catch)</li>
                <li>Sandeep Desai (Added "TADKA" with 3 crucial wkts)</li>
              </ol>
