            <p>HAPPY END OF THE SEASON & Good Start of 2014 !</p>
            <p>@ NCL, Dt : 12/01/14</p>
            <p>PDCA 45 Overs 5th Match :</p>
            <p>Due to the hectic schedules & non-availability of ground it was decided to have this match on Saturday at NCL , Pashan.</p>
            <p>MSEB Captain Paresh won the toss & decided to use the turf first. SCC new bowl bowlers were again not penetrative & Chatanya punished Ravi early on. Chetan bowled good line to balance things for SCC but not before Openers posted over 50 runs in 9 ovrs. Introduction to Spin Twins got breakthrough right away. Dhan trapped Chatanya in front of wicket for 35 runs & Wasim accounted for Akshay for 19 runs ending the opening partnership. Then apart from Paresh Inamdar who attacked Wasim successfully and made aggressive 46 with 7 boundaries , no other MSEB batsman applied & were consumed by Spinners. Dhan Claimed well deserved 5- 41 in 9 overs & Wasim 3-49 in 7 overs to restrict MESB for 148 runs. The total was helped by SCC 29 extras !</p>
            <p>It was decided that SCC should chase the total in 30 overs but by going careful in first 10 overs…</p>
            <p>But SCC Openers went offensive & got a flying start which was missing in last two season. But Soon Wasim got a bad call & was out for 14. MESB thought to break rhythm of Amol by bringing left arm spin of grand Old Prabhune, but was greeted brutally. Amol picking up 30 runs in his two overs. With score reading 65 SCC lost another wicket to bring Old warrior Satish Bhai of SCC. This pair who had over  </p>

            <p> 60 runs unbeaten partnership in their last match teamed up seamlessly & milked MSEB bowlers. Satish batted & matched the settled Partner Amol mixing caution with aggression & hit 8 hits to fence. Amol completed his first 50 of PDCA tournament with a straight drive.</p>
            <p>The strong & assured Jodi once again passed 50 partnerships in style & looked to come undefeated before cheering team mates had some fun when Satish was nearing his half century. A good hit of Satish was saved at Boundary thus needing a single to complete 50 and then since 4 runs were needed, MSEB introduced part time bowler to see him bowl a no ball first up and then a dead ball which was actually hit for 2 runs by Satish but Umpire declared dead ball thus denying a deserving 50 to Satish ….& next ball a good catch ended 80 runs partnership. </p>
            <p>SCC crossed the target with in 20 overs & won the game by 7 wickets to gain full 11 points.</p>
            <p>The foursome team performance by Amol, Bade, wasim & Dhan ended Shinde Leauge season in style for SCC …………..</p>
