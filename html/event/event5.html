            <p>at Dighi Date : 08/12/13 PDCA 45 Overs 3rd Match :</p>
            <p>It was chilly morning as we stepped on to the ground. Losing the toss was, perhaps, the beginning of the bad day at office to follow. The opposition team, Evergreens, elected to bat first. Unexpectedly our young brigade comprising Ravi, Yuvaraj & Chetan failed to deliver like what they are known for. The Evergreens' openers get very good start aided by too many wide balls. They raced away to 90 Runs in the first 10 Overs. We introduced Spin Bowling with Sandeep but he also couldn't stem the flow of the runs from the openers. Then Dhan & Harish took over to play vital role to distract well-set batsmen. Harish forced Sandeep Patil to give a catch to Sandeep. But at the other end, Saurabh Jagdale played very sensible innings to celebrate his ton with the help of Abhi Bhosale & Irshad Shaikh, SCC tried hard to get wickets & control the damage with various options. Harish, Dhan & Akshay bowled well but the damage was already done and Evergreen managed to put up a big score of 271/9.</p>
            <p>Chasing this kind of target, we needed good start but again our openers failed to dominate. It was 4 down in 6 overs and score was just 35. Then Dhan & Yuvi built a good partnership & contributed 50 runs to the total. But again the quick wickets pegged back SCC's progress.</p>
            <p>With wickets falling at regular intervals, it was becoming increasingly difficult to score and achieve the target. Only Subhash could sustain his form to emerge as the top-scorer with 34 runs. SCC was all out for 144 with help of 34 extras in <> overs.</p>
            <p>Have to mention Satish's kind gesture to sit out of the match to give chance to others & Kiran who knew that he was not in the playing 11 but still came to cheer and undertook the scoring job.</p>
