            <p>PDCA Sadu Shinde League (45 overs)</p>
            <p>4th Match : Date - 25/01/15</p>
            <p>Venue : Club Chrysallis ..Kasarsai â€“ 26 Km from Pune</p>
            <p>In absence of regular Captain Dhan, Satish who retired long back from captaincy had to take charge for this match.</p>
            <p>Two debuts in form of Ganesh & Asphak were introduced in SCC team.</p>
            <p>MCC team was boasting of couple Ex -Ranji Trophy players.</p>
            <p>SCC won the toss & elected to field as Team wanted its new generation players to get used to the atmosphere Ravi drew first blood after Satish took a stunning catch at short mid- on to bring downfall of Prashant. Kadam & Manoj played well to take score to 81 before Satish got Kadam out on his well-made 47 runs.</p>
            <p>Manoj was consumed by Sandy & SCC was back in game. Then an excellent 85 run partnership of Kadu & Kumbahre made life difficult for SCC & frequent changes in bowling did not do trick though later SCC fielders did not latch on to the offered catches. Both Batsmen fell subsequently in quick succession to Sandy & Ravi.</p>
            <p>Hemant bowling debut was good & got 2 wickets giving 35 runs in his 9 ovrs. Last 9 overs fetched very little & MCC could reach 220/9 in 45 ovrs. Sandy finished with 4/32 in 8 ovrs.</p>
            <p>SCC did not have sound start from one end though the bowling was mediocre. Parag, Subash, Anurag, Yuvraj & after some resistance Sandy were back in hut . But Amol was in his prime & was showcasing all ranges of his shots & scoring freely from one end . Amol dominated the bowling in such a way that in spite of no contribution SCC reached 100 in 14 overs but had lost 4 wickets.</p>
            <p>Ravi after hitting a big six off Kadam fell next delivery for 14 runs leaving another 85 runs for other 4 batsmen to fight out. Satish joined Amol who was sailing effortlessly but had to be cautious since fall of 6 wickets. In next over Kadam was greeted with two fours by Satish forcing change in bowling. Slowly very important partnership was stitched in context of the match situation & Amol completed his majestic century of a push to the cheer of one & all & looked determined.</p>
            <p>Part time bowler did trick & Satish was bowled for 20 but with still 39 runs & 3 wickets remaining. Hemant joined & seamlessly dig in & instead of taking the pressure vent out & hit 3 sweet boundaries & gave lot of relief to SCC teammates.</p>
            <p>Amol hit a Six in covers to close in for the victory. In next over ( 37th ) SCC got winning runs to big shouts from SCC players.</p>
            <p>Quite obviously Amol was declared MOM for his unbeaten 121(95) - 15X4 & 2X6. More than the runs (since ground was small ) the manner in which Amol batted needs special praise.</p>
