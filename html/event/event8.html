            <p>PDCA T20 4th Match Dt : 27/04/14</p>
            <p>Venue : Dighi</p>
            <p>Having won the toss JSB decided to Bowl first. Sharad tasting first success with his first ball having Amol for a Duck . Nikit & Abhishek defended well but could not push the scoring rate. Nikit was next to go after 9 overs score reading 34. Ravi too perished soon score reading 50 for 3 in 12.1 overs. And in mean time Abhishek was retired to give others a hit.</p>
            <p>This brought two new batsman Sudhakar & Satish at crease. Satish hit first ball square cut to fence and together with Sudhakar had momentum going till Sudhakar got out for brisk 26 (4X4) in 19 balls . Partnership was worth 33 runs in 21 balls. Anurag joined Satish and both continued the pace with Anurag hitting two massive sixes till he misjudged a run. Satish sacrificing his wicket being run out. This partnership yielded 25 runs in 3 over’s.</p>
            <p>SSC could reach a fighting total of 115 /6 in 20 over’s. Last 8 over’s being productive for 66 runs.</p>
            <p>SSC had good start with Nikit picking a wicket in his first over and Ravi too coming good by picking a wicket in his first over score reading 2-5. Then Anchal got in to attacking mode and hitting 4 boundaries and a six before he was snapped by Sandeep not before score reading 50/3 in 8.2 over’s..Mali was bowled first ball by Sandeep trying to cut and SCC was back in to the game.</p>
            <p>Chetan made his first over count by picking two wickets and with 75/6 SCC was in control . Satish & Yuvraj bowled tight but could not break thru till Sharad was LBW for 44 runs in 49 balls with 6 hits to fence off Chetan.</p>
            <p>Score was 88/7 in 15.1 over’s. With 28 runs needed in 29 balls game was tightly poised. The baby of JSB Mayuresh played very well along with Mandhre and clawed towards the line. With Mandhre hitting 12 runs in a over from Chetan game tilted in JSB favor.</p>
            <p>Nikit 19th over was the key over but JSB batsman managed to not only play but get 6 runs. 5 runs were needed in the last over, which JSB got it in 3rd delivery of Satish with Mayuresh hitting winning boundary for JSB.</p>
            <p>The match was good and JSB managed to get past modest total of SSC. Good sign of the match is Anurag ! Just Playing his 2nd Match shows too much confidence with his 2 straight bat sixes.</p>
